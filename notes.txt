1. Copied code (both implementation and tests) from content-disposition npm module.
2. Behaviour of content-disposition has been modified here in pdf.js only for the below case,
   - If there is an invalid encoding in utf8, the npm module will put a replacement character (\ufffd) and parses the rest. However, here in pdf.js, we will throw an error. The reason being, in npm module it uses Buffer class while here we use 
    decodeURIComponent(escape(str));

3. Changed charset of unit_test.html to 'utf-8'. This is to enable testing multi-byte unicode chars in content disposition.
4. Only unit tests are updated. Haven't looked at other tests (or Bots etc.).
