The following changes are made from the original content-disposition npm module,

1. Changed all 'assert's to 'expect's
2. Changed the line indentation and splits matching the linting requirements in pdf.js
3. Changed charset of unit_test.html to 'utf-8'. This is to enable testing multi-byte unicode chars in content disposition.
4. Buffer class in Node.js is not available in browser. So decode 'utf-8' character, we use 
  decodeURIComponent(escape(str));
However this cannot handle invalid unicode encoding pairs. So those test cases are commented now.

TODO :

1. Test InvalidHeaderException
2. Use Object.create in _parseContentDisposition
3. Connect filename in the UI
